# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Instructions
To start the web app, simply run node server.js and then go onto your web-browser and type localhost:3000. I changed the UI a little bit from the previous rendition to make it cleaner. Furthermore, I successfully integrated the OpenWeatherMapAPI. Type in your zip code and your feelings. After that you should see the temperature within your zip-code as well as an updated content field. To make this possible, Asynchronous Javacript calls were used throughout.
